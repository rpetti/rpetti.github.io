  content: I think plenty of them are valid to a certain degree. Though I believe
    their PR is mostly just attempting to gain a strong user-base so they can monetize
    it in the future. Oracle wouldn't give up the Hudson trademark in order to keep
    the community around, claiming it "wasn't a fair deal" for them, so clearly the
    bottom line is their only priority.

<p>So in case you haven't heard, there was some drama between the Hudson community and Oracle. I won't go into detail as there are <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jenkins-ci.org&#47;content&#47;hudsons-future">plenty<&#47;a> of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.artima.com&#47;weblogs&#47;viewpost.jsp?thread=317610">articles<&#47;a> about what went on.</p>
<p>All of the issues that were opened on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;issues.hudson-ci.org&#47;"> the Hudson Jira<&#47;a> for the Perforce plugin are still open, but I'm unassigning those that are assigned to me. I'll continue maintaining the Perforce plugin against Jenkins, so bugs will be tracked <a href="http:&#47;&#47;issues.jenkins-ci.org&#47;">there<&#47;a>, and any fixes I make will be made in the Jenkins repository. Note that the Jenkins version <i>will<&#47;i> still work for Hudson until Oracle&#47;Sonatype and&#47;or the Jenkins Community decide to break cross-compatibility.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the Hudson version is dead, just that it doesn't have an active maintainer. Someone may take over maintaining it, but as far as I know, only one person has been assigned to working on Hudson and the hundreds of plugins written for it.</p>
