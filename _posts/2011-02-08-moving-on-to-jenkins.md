title: Moving on to Jenkins
---
So in case you haven't heard, there was some drama between the Hudson community and Oracle. I won't go into detail as there are [plenty](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/hudsons-future) of [articles](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=317610) about what went on.

All of the issues that were opened on [the Hudson Jira](http://issues.hudson-ci.org/) for the Perforce plugin are still open, but I'm unassigning those that are assigned to me. I'll continue maintaining the Perforce plugin against Jenkins, so bugs will be tracked [there](http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/), and any fixes I make will be made in the Jenkins repository. Note that the Jenkins version __will__ still work for Hudson until Oracle/Sonatype and/or the Jenkins Community decide to break cross-compatibility.

I'm not saying the Hudson version is dead, just that it doesn't have an active maintainer. Someone may take over maintaining it, but as far as I know, only one person has been assigned to working on Hudson and the hundreds of plugins written for it.
