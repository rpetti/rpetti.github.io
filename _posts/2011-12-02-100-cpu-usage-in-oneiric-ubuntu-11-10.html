  content: "THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nI just spent a day trying to work out WTF was going
    on, it wasn't I stumbled upon the fact that maximizing the window made the problem
    go away that I managed to give Google the right keywords to find your blog.\r\n\r\nFor
    the record, I was using the Oxygen-Molecule theme to get GTK apps to look right
    in KDE, it was the cause of the issue!"

<p>I recently upgraded my work PC from Natty to Oneiric, and discovered that whenever I had a window open that <em>wasn't<&#47;em> maximized, it's backend process and xorg would use up 100% of the cpu.</p>
<p>I was nearly about to rebuild my machine when I discovered that it only happened for non-maximized <em>GTK<&#47;em> windows. As a last ditch effort, I ran gtk-theme-switch2, and switch my theme. Magically, this fixed the problem!</p>
<p>Part of the issue was that I'm running in Fluxbox, not Gnome or Unity. I think somehow it got the theme messed up during the upgrade, and since neither Gnome nor Unity had the chance to set it to a correct theme, it borked.</p>
