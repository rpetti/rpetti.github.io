<p>Just ran into this issue while setting up a CentOS 4.7 test virtual machine for some debugging work. After some digging around on the webernets, I found this little <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.virtualbox.org&#47;manual&#47;ch12.html#id497868">gem.<&#47;a></p>
<p>Basically, the kernel is hardcoded for a higher timer frequency than VirtualBox is providing. 10 times in fact. The simple solution is to add <code>divider=10<&#47;code> to the kernel options. This slowed the clock of the guest down to a more accurate level.</p>
